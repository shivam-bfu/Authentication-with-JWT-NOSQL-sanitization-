this is a basic auth using the JWT and is purely sanitized by any kind of  NoSQL injection attack. 

1. "npm i" to install all the dependencies tht are usend in this project 
2. all the sanitization is in the constraintChk.js
3. this gives u a jwt token when signup.
4. make a .env file and in it put 
JWT_KEY="put the security key here it could be anything"
MONGO_URI="put the url here of your mongo db (make sure mongodb compass is installed in your system)"
